# Chat-Room App
Created real-time Node.js based Chat-Room application that allows the user to join any chat room given that the user name is unique for that chat room. Once in chat room users can send and receive messages and location data using Geolocation API. Socket.io was used to enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.
